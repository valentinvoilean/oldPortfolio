I am a Software Engineer specialised in developing front-end functionality for web applications and mobile websites with more than 5 years experience.
I am originally from [Făgăraș](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C4%83g%C4%83ra%C8%99), a city located in the middle of Transilvania, Romania. 

After graduation, I begun to work as an engineer for a customer-oriented IT engineering company from [Brașov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%C8%99ov)
 which was providing IT outsourcing and consultancy services to SMBs and multinational companies.

Meanwhile, I obtained a certification from Microsoft, named "**Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3 Specialist**", automatically becoming a **MCP** member  (Microsoft Certified Professional). I decided to go further, studying the best practices for IT Service Management (ITSM) and obtaining the "**ITIL Foundation Certificate in IT Service Management**".

I am currently living in Barcelona. My better half is Loredana Voilean. We also have a dog that makes our life more awesome.
